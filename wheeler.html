    <h1> Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    
    <h2 class="content-heading1">➢ Is two-wheeler insurance mandatory?</h2>
    <p class="content-faq">Yes, in India, at least a third-party insurance policy is required by law. Riding without insurance can lead to hefty fines and legal repercussions.</p>

    <h2 class="content-heading1">➢ What documents do I need to buy insurance?</h2>
    <p class="content-faq">You'll typically need your driver's license, registration certificate (RC) of your bike, previous year's insurance policy (if applicable), and address
        proof (ID card, Aadhaar card, etc.).</p>


    <h2 class="content-heading1">➢ Can I customize my insurance plan?</h2>
    <p class="content-faq">Absolutely! We offer a variety of add-ons, allowing you to personalize your coverage based on your needs and budget. Whether you want zero
        depreciation cover for full repair value, return to invoice protection for complete loss scenarios, or breakdown assistance for roadside
        emergencies, we have you covered.</p>


    <h2 class="content-heading1">➢ How do I file a claim? </h2>
    <p class="content-faq">Filing a claim with PremiumBima is quick and easy. Simply go online or use our mobile app to submit your claim, upload pictures of the damage,
        and track the progress in real-time. We believe in a transparent and efficient claims process, getting you back on the road faster.</p>

    <h2 class="content-heading1">➢ How long does it take to settle a claim?</h2>
    <p class="content-faq">We strive to settle claims as quickly as possible, understanding the value of your time and the need to get back on the road. On average, claims
        are settled within <strong>7 days,</strong> thanks to our streamlined process and efficient team. You can track the progress of your claim in real-time through our
        online portal or app, ensuring transparency and peace of mind throughout the process.</p>


    <h2 class="content-heading1">➢ What happens if I don't file a claim for several years?</h2>
    <p class="content-faq">Maintaining a clean claim history is rewarded! By opting for rides and avoiding mishaps, you'll be eligible for a <strong>No Claim Bonus (NCB).</strong> This
        translates to attractive discounts on your insurance renewal premiums, year after year. So, ride responsibly and reap the benefits of careful
        riding.</p>


   
    <h2 class="content-heading1">➢ What are the different types of two-wheeler insurance policies?</h2>
    <p class="content-faq">The two main types of two-wheeler insurance are:</p>
    <ul class="content-list">
      <li><strong>Third-Party:</strong> This mandatory policy covers damages caused to third parties, including their vehicles, property, and even injuries. It's a
        basic and affordable option that fulfills legal requirements.</li>
      <li><strong>Comprehensive:</strong> This plan goes beyond the law, protecting both your own bike (in case of accidents, theft, fire, etc.) and third-party
        liabilities. It provides complete peace of mind and is particularly valuable for expensive bikes or riders seeking maximum protection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="content-heading1">➢ Can I choose my own repair garage ?</h2>
    <p class="content-faq">Yes, you have the flexibility to choose any authorized repair garage. However, opting for our <strong>cashless network garages </strong> provides added
        convenience. You won't need to pay upfront repair costs, streamlining the process and saving you time and hassle.</p>

    <h2 class="content-heading1">➢ What happens if my bike is stolen?</h2>
    <p class="content-faq">If your bike is stolen and covered under your policy (comprehensive plans typically include theft coverage), you'll receive compensation based on
        the <strong>Insured Declared Value (IDV)</strong> mentioned in your policy. This value represents the bike's market value at the time of insurance purchase.</p>

    <h2 class="content-heading1">➢ Do I need to renew my insurance every year?</h2>
    <p class="content-faq">Yes, two-wheeler insurance policies are valid for one year only and need to be renewed before they expire to maintain coverage. Don't let your
        protection lapse - remember to renew your policy promptly to avoid any risks.</p>
